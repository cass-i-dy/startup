# RockSlide
## Elevator Pitch
Do you remember a time when you saw a great outcrop and told yourself I better remeber this place, but then you forgot it? Or a friend mentions you can see this great outcrop a little ways off the road, but even though they gave you directions you still can't find it? RockSlide allows you to place a location on a map that represents the location of the outcrop. That location is then visible to all others users on the website. You can also leave comments that allow you to describe the outcrop and for other users to build off of your response.
